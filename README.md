# Software-Test-and-QA


# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my program is functional and secure by making sure to have the appropriate tests when needed and the correct understanding of what the customer wants. If you are testing for something that are both not what the customer wants and wrong code the software will never work. Making sure that the tests are working as needed and having the right amount of coverage is key in the success of testing a program. Also, understanding what a customer needs for the program is essential.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by making piecing them into smaller pieces that can be incorporated into the program easier. It is easier for example like in this project to have a contact file and then have a contact service file in order to make the basics and then tell the basics what to do. This also helps with interpreting the user’s needs. It is easier to incorporate the users’ needs in little pieces then to try to make an entire program and put everything that you will need in one section.

# How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software in incremental segments. I like to think of it by a famous saying, “Rome was not built in a day,” this is what I like to design by. Designers must understand that by having a plan and making that plan fit into smaller sections will ultimately lead to the building of a program just like Rome.
